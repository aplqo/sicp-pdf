Here is a PDF version of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman. 
Low resolution bitmap images are replaced by vector graphics (SVG) and mathematics is typeset in TeX. 
Typography and layout are improved for better on-screen legibility. 

It is based on Neil Van Dyke's Texinfo version (http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi/).
