A PDF version of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman. Low resolution bitmap images are replaced by vector graphics (SVG) and mathematics is typeset in TeX. Typography and layout are improved for better on-screen legibility. This edition is suitable for medium-sized screens (like iPad).

It is based on Neil Van Dyke's Texinfo version: http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi/

Official SICP page with HTML version: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/

(See also http://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pocket/ It's a new project cloned from the current one (sicp-pdf) to adapt the PDF to small screens (like Kindle). We are still in very early stage. Thanks Gavrie (http://github.com/gavrie/sicp-pdf) for the start!)
